# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an AI opponent implemented using the Minimax algorithm. While the underlying UI and game logic were provided by my professor, I developed the Minimax-based decision-making system that allows the AI to play optimally.

## Features
- Fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical interface
- AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm for optimal play
- Human vs. AI gameplay

## Minimax Implementation
The AI decision-making logic is implemented in the `minimaxag.java` file. This algorithm evaluates all possible game states and selects the optimal move to maximize its chances of winning while minimizing potential losses.

## Credits
- UI and game framework: Provided by my professor, Dr. Arisoa Randrianasolo
- Minimax AI implementation: Developed by myself, Wes Orr
