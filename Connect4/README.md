# Connect4 AI

This is a Connect4 game featuring an AI opponent implemented using the Minimax algorithm. While the underlying UI and game logic were provided by my professor, I developed the Minimax-based decision-making system that allows the AI to play optimally.

## Features
- Fully functional Connect4 game with a graphical interface
- AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm for optimal play
- Human vs. AI gameplay

## Minimax Implementation
The AI decision-making logic is implemented in the `minimaxag.java` file. This algorithm evaluates possible game states to a specified depth and selects the optimal move to maximize its chances of winning while minimizing potential losses.
